## blocking without yield in rust async

In asynchronous programming with Rust and Tokio, it is considered a best practice to ensure that all async functions yield control back to the runtime periodically, especially when performing long-running or blocking operations.

Yielding control allows the runtime to schedule other tasks and make progress on concurrent operations, promoting better utilization of system resources and preventing any single task from monopolizing the runtime.

Here are some best practices to follow:

1. Use `async/.await`: Whenever you have an operation that can potentially block or take a significant amount of time, use the `async/.await` syntax to define an asynchronous function and await on the operation. This allows the function to yield control back to the runtime when encountering an `.await` point.

2. Await on I/O operations: When performing I/O operations, such as reading from or writing to files, network sockets, or databases, make sure to use async-aware libraries and await on the I/O operations. This ensures that the task yields control while waiting for the I/O to complete.

3. Spawn blocking operations: If you have CPU-intensive or blocking operations that don't have async counterparts, use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` to execute them in a separate blocking thread. This allows the runtime to continue making progress on other tasks while the blocking operation is running.

4. Avoid long-running loops without yielding: If you have loops that perform continuous computation or processing, make sure to periodically yield control using `tokio::task::yield_now()` or by awaiting on a short-duration `tokio::time::sleep`. This prevents the task from hogging the runtime and starving other tasks.

5. Use async-aware libraries: Whenever possible, use libraries that are designed to work with async programming, such as `tokio` or `async-std`. These libraries provide async versions of various operations and primitives that automatically yield control when appropriate.

By following these best practices and ensuring that all async functions yield control periodically, you can write efficient and responsive asynchronous code that maximizes concurrency and resource utilization within the Tokio runtime.

However, it's worth noting that in some cases, such as when dealing with low-level or performance-critical code, you may need to carefully balance the trade-offs between yielding and efficiency. In such situations, you may need to profile and optimize your code based on the specific requirements of your application.
